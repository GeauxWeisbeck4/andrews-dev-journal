# My name is Andrew and I love to create things on the computer.

I've always been fascinated with technology and computers ever since I was a young child. Why it took me so long to get into web development, I will never know. Partially, it was due to poor guidance by academic counselors when I was younger, but I was also afraid to do what I wanted to with my life for a long time. I thought I had to be miserable with my work, which I realize is so far from the truth.

I orignally wanted to become a game developer after reading about some tech school that taught game developers. I thought it would be so cool to work on the next version of NCAA Football, which was made by EA Sports at the time. My passion for video games was also strong at the time, but I didn't think I was smart enought to be a game developer.

I always thought being a software developer required magical abilities, but anyone could hack shit. That's why I got into hacking things, which I didn't realize at the time was at the essence of any type of software development. Luckily, I decided to pursue becoming a developer after all these years of playing around with it, full-time last year.

## I created this blog to write about various topics

I have a bunch of blogs, but I wanted sort of my own site that paired as a journal and blog about web development. I always like finding people's blogs where they are just loaded with tutorials, info, and personal opinions. That is what this is supposed to be.

The design will start out pretty plain, but I plan on working on this site bit by bit, until it is something big and beautiful. You may also see many posts on this website cross posted on Medium, Hashnode, or Tealfeed as I try to grow my following online.

## More about this blog

This website was created with 11ty and plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As of now, I don't use any other technology - oh, I do use Stackblitz. It's a great web container for creating sites quickly and getting ideas going. I'll work on this more locally in the future I'm sure, but Stackblitz is one of my favorite technologies.

I'll be adding Netlify CMS in the near future, but I plan on deploying this on both Netlify and Vercel, just to kind of see the performance differences out of curiousity. I use README based development to start the project and hope that I can make this blog cool enough to inspire another developer do to somehting similar. I also plan to turn this into an 11ty starter.

# Thank yous

I'd like to thank my wonderful parents, but especially thank my amazing partner Lisa. She has suppported me entirely on this journey - I know it's been extremely difficult at times, but thank you Lisa. I love you more than you know.
